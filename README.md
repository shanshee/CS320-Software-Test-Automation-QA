#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
From the information I gained from this class, I understand that ensuring the functionality and security of my code, program, or software is very important. To ensure my code is functional, I will develop automated test cases that cover a wide range of scenarios and functionalities. I will carefully design these tests to validate the expected behavior of the code or software. By executing these automated tests, I can identify any issues or bugs that might affect the functionality of the program. I will also incorporate unit tests, integration tests, and system tests into my automation framework to comprehensively verify the way the different components interact. By regularly running these tests, I can quickly catch and rectify any functional issues, ensuring that the code or software performs as intended.

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To interpret user needs, I will maintain good documentation of the communication with the user and I would ask them clarying questions to make sure that they have clearly expressed their needs and I fully understand them. Next, I will analyze the requirements in a systematic manner considering both functional and non functional aspects and priotize this based on their importance.

To incorporate user needs into a program through software test automation, I will focus on creating comprehensive test scenarios and cases that cover the user's requirements. I will also develop automated tests using appropriate tools and frameworks, such as JUnit, to validate the functionality and performance of the program. By aligning the automated tests with the user requirements, I can ensure that the program meets their expectations and functions as intended.


#How do I approach designing software?
When designing a software my first step would be to gather and understand the requirements based on the user needs. Based on this information I can define clear goals and objective for the design of the software. Then I will follow the established design principles to create a well structuted software automation. I will break down the functionality into smaller components, to make sure it is operational in every step of the design. Throughout the design process, I will frequently collaborate with my peers to gain valuable feedback and seek input from others to refine and improve my design.
